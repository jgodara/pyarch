# PyArch

This project lets users quickly generate boilerplate projects from PyArch repositories.
Users may always add a repo if the PyArch Central Repo does not have anything that they may like.

## Installation

Clone it, and then:

```shell
$ pip install .
```

## Usage

> A BIG TODO

For now, try `pyarch ls` to list what all projects PyArch Central has.
